# gin-haskell

Do you want to use your github issues as a static website like [this](https://github.com/lifesinger/blog/issues)? Gin can help you!

Gin is a project written in haskell which transforms your posts to github issues automatically.

It works now, but there are some bugs for Windows users, and I need to add some functions in the future.

TODO list:
- [ ] Support local picture uploading
- [ ] Support some extension grammars

BTW, the name **Gin** is from [Gintama (銀魂)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_Tama) which is a funny comic. I hope you like it :smiling_imp:

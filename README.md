# gin-haskell

Do you want to use your github issues as a static website like [this](https://github.com/lifesinger/blog/issues)? Gin can help you!

Gin is a project written in haskell which can parser your posts and transform them to github issues automatically.

It works now, but there are some bugs for Windows users, and I need to add some features in the future.

Features:

:white_check_mark: Support Markdown grammar that [Github supports](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) (because I just upload your post with a few midifications :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)

:white_check_mark: Support creating and modifying your issues posts locally

TODO list:
- [ ] Support local picture uploading
- [ ] Support some extension grammars

BTW, the name **Gin** is from [Gintama (銀魂)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_Tama) which is a funny comic. I hope you like it :smiling_imp:

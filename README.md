# gin-haskell

Do you want to use your github issues as a static website like [this](https://github.com/lifesinger/blog/issues)? Gin can help you!

Gin is a project which transforms your posts to github issues automatically.

It works now, but there are some bugs for Windows users, and I need to add some functions in the future.

TODO list:
- [ ] Support local picture
- [ ] Support some extension grammar
